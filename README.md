## Using "repository" links

There are two main ways how you can download a workshop project from GitHub

1. Download ZIP
    1. Click the green button "code" on the repository's GitHub page
    2. Click "Download ZIP"
1. Pull the Git repository
    1. Install Git
    2. Click the green button "code" and copy the link it gives you
    3. Use the link to clone the repository (precise methods varies with your git installation. It might be `git clone <link>` terminal command or a user interface command).
    4. Checkout the branch you need. `git checkout <branch-name>` or GUI command.

More notes on using Git [HERE](https://github.com/dsba-z/workshops/blob/master/git-guide.md)


## Using "Replit" links

1. Make an account on Replit (you can use your Google account).
2. Open the repository page.
3. Click the blue "fork" button in the top right.
